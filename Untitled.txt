New Computer / Software Equipment Purchase
 
Requestor's Name: Larrisha Akins Department Cost Center: 5410 Department Budget Code: 12470 Desktop Qty: 0 Laptop Qty: 0 Tablet Qty: 0 Justification / Details: As part of my role, I manage the conversion of forms and paperwork that require signatures. A common challenge arises when documents are scanned: once scanned, they become static images (typically in PDF format), which prevents further editing, including adding signatures or making necessary updates. To address this, Adobe Acrobat Pro provides a valuable solution by enabling the conversion of scanned PDF documents into editable Word files. This functionality allows for seamless updates and the insertion of digital signatures, streamlining the workflow and ensuring documents remain actionable and compliant.

Intune – Lockdown of Adobe Reader on iOS
I am currently working on creating an Intune App Protection Policy and App Configuration Policy to restrict Adobe Acrobat Reader on iOS devices. The goal is to configure the application so users can only view PDFs, with copy/paste, save, and share functionality blocked. This will be done using Intune’s configuration designer with the appropriate Adobe AppConfig keys.

Please reference the tab titled “No EUTS Account.” Out of the 523 users on that tab, I am comfortable with removing the 368 that do not have an EUTS account (n/a in column G) and are not active in HR (n/a in column H). For the remaining 160 that are still active in HR, I would recommend review to determine if licenses can be removed.

New Computer / Software Equipment Purchase
 
Requestor's Name: Katelynn Ogle Department Cost Center: 8236 Department Budget Code: 52110 Desktop Qty: 0 Laptop Qty: 0 Tablet Qty: 0 Justification / Details: Melody Steck is a Business Analyst II in the Project Management Office who was on the EPIC project for over the past year. While she was serving as the Testing Manager on that project, she was not using the license and lost it. She is back in the PMO and now that she is working on several other projects, she needs the full desktop version of Visio reinstalled on her machine. She has been using the O365 version to get by, but it does not have all the features she needs to use that the desktop version has, which is making it difficult for her to do her job. Is there an available license that can be installed on her machine, or do we need to look at purchasing the license ourselves? Thank you for your help!

New Computer / Software Equipment Purchase
 
Requestor's Name: Amaya Fernandez Department Cost Center: 8010 Department Budget Code: 0 Desktop Qty: 0 Laptop Qty: 0 Tablet Qty: 0 Justification / Details: My computer, which used to be VDI, was suddenly remotely switched to an auto log computer on 01/20/25 without any warning or notice. Since then, I've been having to log onto Storefront VDI desktop in order to access my Microsoft E3 license applications, complete Manager reports that are in shared network drives, and send faxes through Centralis. I am also concerned this will affect Epic Deployment as the computer number does not match what was logged by Epic. This switch to auto log has severely impacted productivity, and I have gone almost a month without any response or resolution. I was advised by IT to submit this form, but I wasn't sure how to classify it. The computer still has the badge scanner plugged in.

Kerberoast Attack is Possible
Several service accounts have Service Principal Names (SPNs), which are used to identify Windows service instances uniquely. When a domain account is used for a specific service in the environment, an SPN is used to associate the service with a login account. Users then receive a Kerberos ticket-granting service (TGS) ticket, signed with the NTLM hash of the account operating the service. Consequently, an authenticated domain user can request a TGS ticket for any SPN, receive the hash of the affected account, and attempt to crack it offline. In the information security community, this is known as Kerberoasting. Recommendation Use Microsoft’s Managed Service Account functionality, along with long (more than 30-character length) randomly generated passphrases for service accounts. This will reduce the likelihood of hashes being cracked, even if they are obtained through Kerberoasting. Moreover, use Microsoft Defender for Identity (previously known as Microsoft ATA) to detect and alert Kerberoasting activity. The adsecurity.org blog, listed in the references, provides details on specific event IDs to monitor. An open-source project, WatchAD, also implements several Microsoft Defender for Identity detections without requiring licensing and can be used as a point of reference for detection logic.

To accomplish this, we'd like PMO to lead the transition of data from these current environments to a new TMH account on AWS and to our existing Qlik Cloud account by 6/30/25. IPC Global is the suggested vendor for these reasons:<br /> 1) They have expertise with AWS, and Hari recommends AWS for this application.<br /> 2) They successfully helped TMH install Qlik Cloud and provision a Qlik Gateway previously.<br /> 3) They are Qlik's preferred vendor.<br /> <br /> <strong><span style="font-family:OpenSans">Why is this proposal important to the organization and why is it important now?</span></strong><br /> Implementation needs to be completed by 6/30/25 to allow Hari Meda to shut down the obsolete QLIKTEST01 and PERFORM01 servers. Also, 6/30/25 is the termination date for our Health Catalyst contract.<br /> 1) Install a Qlik Gateway on the Epic servers, and/or consider FAQ – Epic on FHIR connector (<a href="https://fhir.epic.com/FAQ">https://fhir.epic.com/FAQ</a>) available for Qlik Cloud by 3/1/25.<br /> 2) Provision a TMH-specific account on AWS for SQL Server (or MYSQL Server) and S3 cloud storage. We will need to move the following data to the SQL Server or MYSQL Server within AWS:<br /> a. AdHocXP data (up to 30GB) – by 6/1/25<br /> b. Health Catalyst data (up to 12TB) – by 6/30/25<br /> c. Set-up email server account and settings from Qlik Cloud to TMH email server by 6/1/25.<br /> d. Implement Qlik Replicate for Finance’s on-prem Oracle server by 6/1/25. &lt;Only pursue this feature if there is a low, one-time cost.&gt;<br /> e. Convert Health Catalyst files to QVDs by 6/30/25.<br /> B2.1 - Which specific business process(es) does this request address?<br /> Regulatory reporting and internal clinical and operational analytics for TMH decision-makers.<br /> <br /> B2.2 - Describe any alternate solution(s) explored.<br /> 1) Status quo - not recommended since current costs exceed $2M/year for Health Catalyst, and the two servers are obsolete and can no longer be maintained.<br /> 2) Eliminate the legacy reporting data - not recommended since many regulatory and internal TMH data requests require retrospective data that will not be available in Epic or Infor. Also, while Galen will have much of the raw data, we need the data models already created on our servers and in Health Catalyst since those are validated and report-ready.<br /> 3) Use Azure instead of AWS for storage - not recommended since Qlik is already hosted on AWS, which will simplify security and data flows.<br /> <br /> B2.3 - If implemented, what will be the magnitude of workflow changes on employee populations?<br /> Low Impact for Small Employee Population<br /> <br /> B2.4 - What effect will these workflow changes have regarding workload?<br /> Decreased workload<br /> B2.0 - Business Process Continued<br /> B2.4.1 - Briefly describe the plan for staff in response to the decreased workload<br /> By storing the data in AWS and Qlik Could, the Analytics Team will have ready-access to curated legacy data for generating reports and analysis when requested by regulatory agencies and internal TMH decision-makers. This will also enable much quicker and better aggregation of data between Epic and the legacy systems.<br /> B2.0 - Business Process Continued<br /> B2.4.2 - Briefly describe the current related high-level workflow.<br /> To fulfill data requests, we currently pull data from either Health Catalyst or from our databases hosted on our servers.
