Good afternoon, David, 

Yes, you would need to submit a hardware software request and then send it over to the Devices team. Once they have purchased the license then I will be able to assign it to you.

Good Morning,

 

Hope all is well. Please give me a call concerning Adobe. I no longer have access to edit forms etc. The upgrade for the newest version was requested for myself and my staff. They have access however, I don’t. Not sure what needs to be done to get this resolved.

Good morning,

 

This is a friendly reminder regarding the recent communication on Adobe Acrobat licensing.

 

To ensure uninterrupted access, please make sure a Hardware/Software Request Form for Adobe Acrobat Pro has been submitted before October 1:

 

If your department has submitted the request form by the deadline, users will retain access while the license is being processed.
 

If no request form is submitted by October 1, access to Adobe Acrobat will be removed.
 

We encourage you to work with your department leadership to confirm that requests are submitted in a timely manner. Taking action now will help avoid any disruption in access to Adobe.

 

Thank you for your prompt attention and cooperation.

 

Warm regards,

Hey David,

The price per license unfortunately varies from time to time. Currently, the cost is around $255 per license annually.

We do have a method in place to determine which users and departments utilize Adobe the most. This helps us identify where licenses are most critical and where consolidation might be possible to ensure efficient use of funds.

Michael,

To ensure that we are practicing good stewardship of our funds, what is the cost of an Adobe Acrobat Pro subscription license?

I would encourage departments to limit or centralize the use wherever possible to help control costs.  Does I.T. have a way to assess usage history to determine need for the license?

Hi Michael,

 

We have several licenses up here in the Lab, all of the managers and a couple of supervisors.  Do I need to gather the e0#’s or device names or ??? for you?

 

And …   I actually need to edit a .pdf and resubmit to SPARK, and  it appears I no longer have a valid license.

 

Can you assist?

 

Thanks! Robbie

We did reach out to CDW regarding bulk purchasing, but unfortunately, they weren’t able to provide a discount. At this time, the cost for Adobe Acrobat Pro is around $254 per license. Please note that this price can fluctuate slightly depending on the number of licenses being purchased.

Departments will need to plan for this cost in their budgets and submit purchase orders for any required licenses ahead of the October 1 deadline.

Good evening,

 

As a follow-up to my earlier message, here’s what you need to know regarding the transition with Adobe Acrobat Pro licensing.

Due to known security vulnerabilities Adobe has officially ended the sale of perpetual Acrobat licenses and has shifted entirely to a subscription-based model. Per Adobe's licensing updates, acquisition of perpetual-license upgrades officially ended December 1, 2021, and renewals under those programs were terminated by February 1, 2022.

Moving forward, anyone who on an older version of Adobe and needs Adobe Acrobat Pro will need to submit a purchase order for a subscription license before the October 1st cutoff. This ensures compliance with security standards and uninterrupted access to Adobe.

If you actively use Adobe Acrobat Pro and anticipate needing a license, please coordinate with your department to place the purchase order.

Warm regards,
